# Python Requirements for CSV to NGSI-LD Conversion Scripts
# All dependencies are from Python standard library - no external packages needed

# Standard library modules used:
# - json: JSON parsing and manipulation
# - csv: CSV file reading and writing
# - os: File system operations and path handling
# - glob: File pattern matching for CSV discovery
# - urllib: HTTP client for REST API requests
# - time: Time-related functions and sleep operations
# - random: Random sampling for verification scripts

# No external dependencies required - Python 3.6+ standard library is sufficient
